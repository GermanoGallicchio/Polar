# Polar
A circular statistics toolbox for computing angular and radial metrics.

## Overview
Polar is a toolbox designed to provide tools for analyzing circular data. It includes functions for calculating angular and radial metrics.

## Features
- Compute mean resultant vectors (e.g., used for Inter-Trial Phase Clustering, Phase Locking, Phase Amplitude Coupling)
- Optional trimming of outliers
- Perform transformations (e.g., logit, FisherZ)
